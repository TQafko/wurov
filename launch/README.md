This directory contains launch files. To run a launch file, run `roslaunch auv <launch_file.launch>`. For example,
to run the entire system in a simulation, run `roslaunch auv simulate.launch`. 

- core runs the core enbarr stuff. It's not useful on its own, but is useful when called from other launch files.
